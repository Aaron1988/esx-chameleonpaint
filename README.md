## Description
A simple script to use an item to apply chameleon paint to vehicles in fivem. Converted from QB-Core version to ESX.

The meta and texture files found in the `data` and `stream` folders must be present for this to work.

## UPDATES
- Updated to work on **2802** gamebuild.
- Corrected GetSharedObject deprecated.

## TO-DO
- Actually it has **only the first 16 released colors**. It has to be updated to the actual 65.
- I would like to convert it to esx-progressbar, but when I try it stucks after the first progressbar and doesn't stop animation of shaking.
